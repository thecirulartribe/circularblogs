        <h2>DATA CONTROLLER AND CONTRACTING PARTIES</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Data Controller</b> means a natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or  in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the  manner in which any personal data are, or are to be, processed. For the purpose  of this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of your data.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Data Processors (or Service Providers)</b> means any natural or legal person  who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. We may use the  services of various Service Providers in order to process your data more  effectively.

            Changes to the Privacy Policy apply to your use of our Services after the  “effective date”. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The CircularTribe (“we” or “us”) can modify this Privacy Policy, and if we make  material changes to it, we will provide notice through our services, or by other  means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they  become effective.

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>1. DATA WE COLLECT</h2>
        <h3>1.1. Data you provide to us</h3>
        <p>You provide data to create an account with us.</p>
        <h4>REGISTRATION</h4>
        <p>
            To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email  address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password.

        <h4>PROFILE</h4>
        <p>
            You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your photos,  city/area, and occupation. You don’t have to provide additional information on  your profile; however, profile information helps you get more from our Services,  including helping people with similar interests around you to find you. It’s your  choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that  sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your  profile that you would not want to be publicly available.

        </p>
        <h2>2. HOW WE USE YOUR DATA</h2>
        <p>
            How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how  you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. We use the  data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including  with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our  Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others.
        </p>
        <h3>2.1. SERVICES</h3>
        <p>
            We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honour your settings. STAY INFORMED
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas  regarding topics you care about, and from people you respect. Our Services  also allow you to improve your sustainability initiatives, or join new ones. We  use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from  your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we  have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending  or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. So, if you let us  know that you are interested in a new thing (e.g., by interacting with a post), we  will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you  follow certain members on our site, or suggest related content to help you  towards achieving that new initiative. We use your content, activity and other  data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and  others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you  have updated your profile, posted content, took a social action, used a feature,  made new connections or were mentioned in the news.
        </p>
        <h3>2.2. COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
        <p>
            We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our  websites or apps, messages to your inbox, and other ways through our  Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you  messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network  updates, reminders, suggestions and promotional messages from us and our  partners. You may change your communication preferences at any time. Please  be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us,  including security and legal notices.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3. ADVERTISING</h3>
        <p>
            We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and  others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners,  using the following data, whether separately or combined:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, pixels, ad  tags, cookies, and device identifiers;       
                </li>
                <li>
                    Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and  industry);
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content  you read, groups participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on  an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
                </li>
                <li>

        </p>
        <h4>AD CHOICES</h4>
        <p>
            We adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and  participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of  receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed  with these self-regulatory tools. You can also opt-out specifically from our uses  of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads.
        </p>
        <h3>2.4. MARKETING</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for  invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth,  engagement and our Services, such as by showing your followers that you have  used a feature on our Services.
        </p>
        <h3>2.5. DEVELOPING SERVICES AND RESEARCH</h3>
        <h4>SERVICE DEVELOPMENT</h4>
        <p>
            We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development  for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive  and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on  our Services, and help promote sustainability and green initiatives.
