  </p>
  <p>
    Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas  regarding topics you care about, and from people you respect. Our Services  also allow you to improve your sustainability initiatives, or join new ones. We  use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from  your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we  have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending  or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. So, if you let us  know that you are interested in a new thing (e.g., by interacting with a post), we  will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you  follow certain members on our site, or suggest related content to help you  towards achieving that new initiative. We use your content, activity and other  data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and  others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you  have updated your profile, posted content, took a social action, used a feature,  made new connections or were mentioned in the news.

  <p>
    Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations to promote and  achieve sustainability through an interactive and comprehensive platform.

  <p>
    The results of our research are shared as aggregated data, ensuring that  individual identities are protected.

  <h2>3. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h2>
  <h3>3.1. OUR SERVICES</h3>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h3>3.2. THIRD PARTY SERVICES</h3>
  <p>
    Subject to your settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt  to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to  them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked  to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving  them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the  link with such accounts.
  </p>
  <h3>3.3. RELATED SERVICES</h3>
  <p>
    We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our  Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services  covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful  to you and others.

  <h3>3.4. SERVICE PROVIDERS</h3>
  <p>
    We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. For instance, we partner with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising to capture how you use and interact with our website through behavioural metrics, heatmaps, and session replay to improve and market our products/services. Website usage data is captured using first and third-party cookies and other tracking technologies to determine the popularity of products/services and online activity. Additionally, we use this information for site optimization, fraud/security purposes, and advertising. For more information about how Microsoft collects and uses your data, visit the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/privacystatement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Privacy Statement.</a>
  </p>
  <h3>3.5. LEGAL DISCLOSURES</h3>
  <p>
    It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required  by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that  disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action  regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government  enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and  defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the  security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing  similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of The  CircularTribe, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members  about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment,  unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency.  We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the  requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise  to challenge every demand.
  </p>
  <h3>3.6. CHANGE IN CONTROL OR SALE</h3>
  <p>
    We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in  control, or in preparation for any of these events.
